        <div class="content">
          <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
          <p>
            By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
            apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
            carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
            modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
            You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
            and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages
            with out permission from Senapp Studios, or make derivative
            versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
            database rights and other intellectual property rights related to
            it, still belong to Senapp Studios and or parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senapp Studios is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
            and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to

            services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senapp Studios can not be held accountable for how you use our apps
            functions or how you name, add, or edit elements in our app, this
            means any insulting, provactive, copyrighted, trademarked, or
            offensive material you have created is not Senapp Studios
            responsible for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our apps stores and processes personal data that you have provided
            to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
            keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process
            of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
            official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
            vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
            phone’s security features and it could mean that the our apps won’t
            work properly or at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that Senapp
            Studios will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
            app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
            connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
            provider, but Senapp Studios cannot take responsibility for the app
            not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
            and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In
            using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
            including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your
            home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the same lines, Senapp Studios cannot always take
            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
            sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Senapp Studios cannot
            accept responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to Senapp Studios’s responsibility for your use of the
            app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
            although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at
            all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us
            so that we can make it available to you. Senapp Studios accepts no
            liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
            result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
            available on Android and IOS – the requirements for system(and for any
            additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
            to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
            to keep using the app. Senapp Studios does not promise that it will
            always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
            with the Android or IOS version that you have installed on your device.
            However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
            when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and
            may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
            termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
